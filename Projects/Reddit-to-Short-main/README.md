2. **YouTube API:**
    * Enable the YouTube Data API v4 in the Google Cloud Console ([https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3))
    * Download your `client_secrets.json` file and place it in the same directory as `main.py`.
    * Refer to this tutorial for detailed instructions: [https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3)

**Running the Script**

1. Ensure you've completed the configuration steps.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

**New to Python?**

If you're unfamiliar with running Python scripts in the terminal, right-click on `main.py` and choose "Open with" followed by Python's launcher.

**Code Structure**

The code is organized into well-defined modules for clarity and maintainability:

* `reddit_api.py`: Handles interaction with the Reddit API for fetching content.
* `video_editor.py`: Responsible for transforming raw video into an engaging YouTube Short format.
* `youtube_api.py`: Manages uploading the converted Short to your YouTube channel.
